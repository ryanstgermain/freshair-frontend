# FRESHAIRideApp

This project was generated by Muscle Cakes with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.3.

## About the Project

This app we built is for people who struggle to find a car pool to go to the mountain and back.
The problem we hope to help solve is to lower traffic congestion and save money as well.
The app is designed for people who travel to the mountains and people who are looking to earn some extra money on the side.
